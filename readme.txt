PHPAC
=====

I have recently rediscovered the joys of good autocompletion and
jump-to-definition by way of [Tern.js](http://ternjs.net/) and
[Jedi](http://jedi.jedidjah.ch/en/latest/).

Sadly, my paying gigs tend to be for writing PHP. As an Emacser, I greatly
appreciate [ejmr](https://github.com/ejmr/php-mode)'s wonderful work to
modernize php-mode, which has made my life a great deal easier. Now that I
intelligent code assistance when writing JS and Python, I have begun to miss it
terribly when dealing with PHP.

After reading [the author's description of Tern's
innards](http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/tern.html), I thought "I wonder how
hard it would be to come up with a similar tool for PHP?"

It may prove far beyond the level of energy I'm willing to devote, given PHP's
abominable complexities as a language, but having found a pretty
powerful-looking parser, I've decided to try a little prototyping.

We'll see how it goes.
